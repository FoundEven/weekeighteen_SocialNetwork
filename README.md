## Description

My motivation for creating this projest was to show that I could use mongoose and mongodb in a project. I made this project learn more about how mongodb and mongoose interact with express. This solves the problem of learning how mongodb and routes work together to create a functioning database. I learned from this project was how to create my own models for mongodb and routes for mongodb.

## Installation

You will need node installed.

You will need to install mongoose and express.

You will need Insomnia installed.

## Usage

To start it you will need to type npm run start in the terminal to start the server. Then you will need to use Insomnia to call the routes.
